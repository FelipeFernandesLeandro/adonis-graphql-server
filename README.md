# Adonis API server

This project is a GraphQL server with the concept of a basic blog. The blog will have User and Post entities. Weâ€™ll be able to create users and authenticate them using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). Authenticated users will be able to create posts.

## Setup

Use the adonis command to install the blueprint

```bash
adonis new yardstick --api-only
```

or manually clone the repo and then run `npm install`.


### Migrations

Run the following command to run startup migrations.

```js
adonis migration:run
```

## Testing

Use Insomnia as REST client

```
adonis serve --dev
```

### Create a new user
```
POST http://127.0.0.1:3333/graphql
mutation {
    createUser(username: "mezie", email: "mezie@example.com", password: "password") {
        id
        username
        email
    }
}
```

### Login
```
mutation {
    login(email: "mezie@example.com", password: "password")
}
```

### Create a post while logged
```
auth with the JWT returned, selecting Bearer Token and paste the JWT

mutation {
    addPost(title: "Hello Adonis", content: "Adonis is awesome!") {
        id
        title
        slug
        content
        user {
            username
            email
        }
    }
}
```
